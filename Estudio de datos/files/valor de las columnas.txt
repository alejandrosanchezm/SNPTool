- 36 CADD - Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion. "Raw" CADD scores come straight from the model, and are interpretable as the extent to which the annotation profile for a given variant suggests that the variant is likely to be "observed" (negative values) vs "simulated" (positive values). These values have no absolute unit of meaning and are incomparable across distinct annotation combinations, training sets, or model parameters. However, raw values do have relative meaning, with higher values indicating that a variant is more likely to be simulated (or "not observed") and therefore more likely to have deleterious effects.
- 37 CADD - Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion.  "PHRED-scaled" those values by expressing the rank in order of magnitude terms rather than the precise rank itself. For example, reference genome single nucleotide variants at the 10th-% of CADD scores are assigned to CADD-10, top 1% to CADD-20, top 0.1% to CADD-30, etc. The results of this transformation are the "scaled" CADD scores.
